# IP-tracker
Automated IP check which sends an Email if you IP changed

# Getting started
Just run gui.py.

# Prerequisites
1. You need to have an gmail account. (sorry only works for gmail atm.)
2. You need to activate "less secure apps" for the account

# Important!!!
At the moment this program will store your username and password only base64 encoded in a textfile on the computer. This is not a very safe method.
